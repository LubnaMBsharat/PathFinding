# Pathfinding Game Implementation

This project creates a grid-based environment where users can customize the dimensions. Users have the ability to set the start, target, and wall nodes on the grid. The A* algorithm is then employed to find the shortest path from the specified start node to the target node.

## Features:
### Map Customization:
Users can manually set obstacles on the map or leverage the convenience of a "Generate Map" button to introduce random obstacles.

### Node Selection:
Once the map is generated, users have the freedom to designate the start node and up to two target nodes.

### A* Algorithm:
The project includes an implementation of the A* algorithm, a powerful pathfinding algorithm known for finding the shortest path between two points.

### Distance Algorithms:
Users can choose from a selection of distance algorithms to influence the pathfinding process. The project provides an implementation for the Manhattan and the Euclidean distance.

## How to Use:
### Map Generation:
1. Choose the dimensions of the map.
2. Manually place obstacles or use the "Generate Map" button for a random obstacle arrangement.
   
### Node Selection:
Indicate the start node and one or two target nodes on the generated map.

### Distance Algorithms Customization:
Select the desired distance algorithm to influence the pathfinding calculations.

###### Click PLAY and let the A* Algorithm discover the shortest path to your designated target. Witness its journey through the nodes, where it colors each visited node, unveiling the sequence it follows to pinpoint the optimal path for you.
